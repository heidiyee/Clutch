                    <p> ACTING WITH URGENCY AND INTENTION<br><br>

                        Strategic Change is at the foundation of our work. Together with our clients, we restructure organizations, operations and marketing plans to achieve critical objectives. <br><br>

                        In the fast-forward economy, recognizing and capitalizing on the emergent market is a significant predictor of success. Executives recognize the imperative for strategic change, but are challenged to manage the present while grappling with the scope and complexity of strategic change initiatives. <br><br>

                        Through an intensive diagnostic phase, we rapidly direct resources, adapt organizational structure, adjust corporate policy and practice, and address your mission – to shift to higher performance. <br><br>

                        Clutch helps clients understand, plan for, commit to, and engage in the process of strategic change, harnessing the resources and organizational will required to drive business results.

                        IT'S CHOOSING TO BE WAY, WAY AHEAD <br><br>

                        Clutch helps clients make faster, smoother shifts through technology.<br><br>

                        Many (perhaps too many) technology initiatives are driven by the pangs to bring systems “current.” But as technology becomes the backbone to delivering customer value, merely being current means being at competitive parity – or same. <br><br>

                        And “same” – over time – often means “dead.” <br><br>

                        Deep experience in both strategy and operational transformation makes us uniquely suited to define and support complex technology transformations, preparing information-powered businesses to move further, faster.<br><br>

                        We enable IT to support broader business goals, while addressing the most effective models; performance criteria; governance and decision-making processes, and; organizational alignment and incentives. <br><br>

                        Clutch helps you identify, synthesize, integrate and extend technology faster than your competition. And so we’ll create a market advantage in business management, operations and/or customer experience. <br><br>

                        If you need to address cost, quality and cycle time, we will help meet growing demand; manage the project portfolio; rationalize applications; evaluate and establish sourcing/partner models; conduct value analysis; run a lean/agile development; establish performance management and – critically – build future capability.<br><br>

                        And in the process get you ready to keep doing it again, and again.

                <p>
                    Information-starved organizations, often bogged-down in IT maintenance. Lack of continuous, enterprise planning results in disparate, patchwork systems that frustrate the delivery of value from information.

                <p>
                     Information-enabled companies reactive to changes in technological capability. Often hesitant to challenge their own capabilities, and so making industry-standard upgrades. Occasionally take initiatives with peripheral IT applications, but vision lacks ambition.

                <p>
                     Companies enjoying temporal, tactical advantages from information technology, often based on the timing of their technology cycle. Often regard their privileged technologies as providing sustainable advantages, and so exhibit some latency in pursuing next generation opportunities.

                     A competitively buoyant company, embracing and managing risk associated with IT leadership. Pioneers new ways of delivering value by actively and continuously adapting emergent technologies. Sees IT as a continuous, integrated challenge for performance, not “projects.”

                        WHEN DISCIPLINE BECOMES DEMISE <br><br>

                        We help clients seize opportunity from the costs and complexity of systems that have grown around them.<br><br>

                        Fierce market competitiveness, productivity mandates (and lots and lots of management books) have compelled organizations to measure, poke and prod for ever higher performance: Six Sigma. Net Promoter. Lean. Kaizen...<br><br>

                        But while businesses have become quantifiably more precise, they are often overly burdened by the very methods and processes intended to help.<br><br>

                        Often routines that are elevated to “important” don’t equate to processes that add “value.” And so a growing business slows, calcified by structures and rules that don’t reflect the dynamism, speed and agility required in performance.<br><br>

                        Our approach to process and operational transformation shifts businesses: To move from information-burdened, to intelligence-enabled. To move from lean and mean, to fit and finessed.<br><br>

                        No longer should leadership lament “This was much easier when we were small.” Here, we embrace the challenge to “Act small. Deliver big.”<br><br>

                        Providing insights on technology, infrastructure, logistics policy, structural and cultural challenges – we blend rigor with flexibility to ignite performance.

                        NURTURING HIGH PERFORMANCE TEAMS <br><br>

                        Business is a constellation of individuals, each with their own attitudes, values, beliefs and behaviors. We believe that culture shouldn’t define the business – it should enable the business. So we work with you to understand and address the challenges and opportunities to align company culture with business strategy to inspire individuals and drive performance. <br><br>

                        What are the underlying causes of a meeting culture that bleeds away resources? Does obsession with the org chart frustrate effective, timely decision-making? Does the taxonomy of job titles – SVP, EVP, Executive VP, Regional VP – shape perceptions or inform behavior in negative ways? <br><br>

                        We seek sustainably high returns from human capital, helping you shape culture to serve strategy, improve organizational design and foster the rapid exchange of resources across companies to make them bright, vibrant performers at any size. <br><br>

                        INNOVATION IS CREATIVITY READY TO EARN A LIVING <br><br>

                        Clutch helps our clients drive business performance through external innovation (products and services) and internal innovation (business models and processes).<br><br>

                        Innovation isn’t the mere inventiveness of new “stuff”: It means discovering new ways to deliver customer-centered value. We recognize most businesses already have lots of ideas. The challenge is to select and implement the best ideas in a sustained, timely and resource-efficient way. <br><br>

                        We help you cultivate a culture of possibilities, with permission to think differently. We embolden you to assess the market desire and financial viability of new ideas, unburdened from the parameters and constraints of today’s business. Through rapid prototyping and redesign, we help you overcome the analysis paralysis that can slow innovation and stifle change.<br><br>

                        Emphasizing agility and scalability, we work with you to develop a structure and management for R&amp;D, collaboration and performance management to support (not dictate) the direction and outcomes. <br><br>

                        Vitally, we help you organize your innovation pipeline around market opportunity and customer need. <br><br>

                        The paradox of innovation at larger, more mature companies is this: The need to innovate is inversely proportionate to their capacity to innovate. We help you liberate ideas to create opportunity and realize fresh business. <br><br>
