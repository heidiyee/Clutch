                    PROGRAM MANAGEMENT<br><br>

                    An enterprise telecommunications client undertook a significant marketing initiative, requiring the transition of IT responsibilities from vendor resources to an internal team – while the project was in flight.

                        While the vendors were experts in agile scrum development, the client’s internal IT team had no prior experience in the discipline. As a result, the velocity of iterations was compromised by the resources required for internal ramp-up, and product features were being delivered only every 2 weeks. As some iteration points were sacrificed entirely, confidence from the business customer weakened. It was critical for the transition to take place more quickly and smoothly to ensure iteration commitments would meet marketing demands.

                        Clutch initiated a transition plan, and through Iteration Retrospectives revealed further opportunities to improve product backlog management and iteration planning processes. <br><br>

                        A secondary plan was designed to streamline approaches in the product roadmap realization, with specific roles were to improve product definition early in the process. Delegates of the product owner and IT analysts were paired and made accountable for strategic user stories (epics) for prioritization, grooming and elaboration. As they became subject matter experts for user stories, the stories became more well-defined and ready for iteration planning. As a result, greater attention could be paid to managing future work.

                        Within the framework Clutch established, daily scrum stand ups were conducted to status current iteration efforts and separate scrum ceremonies brought focus to maturing user stories and future work. The progress of each user story’s development was tracked to ensure there was a viable pipeline ready for iteration planning and code/test development. As user stories groomed in advance and better defined, the two week iteration cycle was primarily utilized for code, testing and delivery.
