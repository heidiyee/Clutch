                        MORE INSPIRATIONAL. LESS INSTITUTIONAL.<br><br>

                        In 2005, Clutch was launched (as LG Consulting) by Tom Taft and Jeff Hibbert, founders of The Laurel Group, an executive search firm. <br><br>

                        Through relationships with top executives they recognized demand in high-growth businesses for seasoned, focused professionals to deliver results. <br><br>

                        The firm quietly grew to over 100 professionals serving diverse clients across finance, insurance, healthcare, technology, mobility and retail. <br><br>

                        In 2013, Brad Myers became a partner, joined by technology executive Steven Anderson. Together, they focused on growing the company across the West Coast, precipitating the transformation to Clutch in 2014.
